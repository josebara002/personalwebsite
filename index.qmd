## About Me

I'm a data scientist working in vaccines manufacturing where I support and manage data driven projects (in a GMP context) through ETL work, ML modling, data visualizations and (now recently) GenAI. In previous rolls I've worked as an automation engineer in manufacturing supporting MES systems and process automation.

A Long Island NY native, now living in Durham NC since 2020. In my free time I enjoy board games, playing cello in a community orchestra, and playing video games.
